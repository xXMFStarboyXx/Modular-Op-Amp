This Project serves as an attempt in making a Verilog A based Modular OpAmp intended for easy parameter passing and testing before schematic designing.

The files attached (Project) refers to the first trial in making the project the initial set of codes used and also the parameters based on which the various modules(Input Stage, Output Stage, etc) were made.

The Training file has all the actual Verilog a codes used, the symbols etc.

I ended this project after discovering 2 fatal errors in my project:
1) Attempting to make a Modular Veriolg-A project 
2) I wasn't able to resolve the Oscillations generated

I took help from AI to guide me in making the modules, rectifying errors or understand concepts especially "DC Convergence Error" which i came across multiple times.

As a conclusion i would like to state ill try making simpler Verilog A modules next time onwards and would only try designing it for only particular parameters which would be criticalk for the intended purpose.
